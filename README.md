# Face Detection with Eyes and Smile Detection

This project uses the OpenCV library to detect faces, eyes, and smiles in video streams. It utilizes pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect these features. The program processes video from your camera in real-time and highlights the detected features with rectangles.

## Features:
- Face detection in video
- Eye detection within the face
- Smile detection within the face
- Displays video with rectangles drawn around detected features

## Prerequisites:
To run this program, you need the following libraries:
- OpenCV
- NumPy

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy

```
